# ScaleBuds — Brand Voice & Style Guide

## Who We Are
- AI automation and marketing agency helping SaaS founders fix their leaky funnels and scale efficiently
- Services: AI-powered marketing automation, lead generation systems, content repurposing, growth strategy
- Founded by a creator with 100K+ YouTube subscribers — we practice what we preach
- Product: Raycaster — an AI writing tool for founders who want substance over slop

## Target Audience
- **The Person:** "Alex" — a SaaS founder or early-stage CEO doing $10K-$500K MRR. They've built something real but they're stuck. Marketing feels like guesswork, leads trickle in, and every dollar spent on ads feels like pouring water into a bucket with holes.
- **Their Pain:** They know they need marketing but hate the generic, soulless content that AI tools spit out. They've tried agencies that over-promise and under-deliver. They're drowning in tools but starving for results.
- **Their Desire:** A marketing system that actually works — predictable leads, content that sounds like them (not a robot), and automation that saves time without sacrificing quality.
- **Where they hang out:** LinkedIn, X (Twitter), YouTube, Indie Hackers, Product Hunt, SaaS-focused Discord/Slack communities, Reddit (r/SaaS, r/startups, r/Entrepreneur)

## Tone & Voice
| Attribute    | Description |
|------------- |-------------|
| Formality    | Casual but credible. Like a friend who also happens to be crushing it. No corporate jargon, no fluff. |
| Energy       | Bold and high-energy. We don't whisper — we lead with confidence. Every post hits with impact. |
| Humor        | Sharp, self-aware, occasionally irreverent. We call out BS in the industry. "Substance Over Slop." |
| Warmth       | Peer-to-peer. We've been in the trenches. "We" language. Like talking to someone who genuinely gets it. |

### Signature Phrases
- "Scale smarter, not a leaky bucket." — core tagline
- "Substance Over Slop." — anti-generic-AI positioning
- "Stop guessing. Start scaling." — CTA energy
- "Your marketing shouldn't sound like a robot trying to sell a PDF." — personality
- Short, punchy, action-oriented. Lead with the problem, close with the solution.

### What We NEVER Do
- No generic "grow your business!" motivational fluff — we're specific and tactical
- No robotic AI-sounding content — ironic for an AI company, but that's the point
- No desperate sales language ("limited time!", "act now!") — we attract, not chase
- No stock photos of handshakes or people pointing at whiteboards — our visuals have personality
- No walls of text — we keep it tight and scannable
- No talking down to our audience — they're smart founders, we respect that

## Visual Identity
- **Color Palette:**
  - **Primary:** Pop Art brights — Electric Blue (#0066FF), Hot Pink (#FF1493), Vibrant Orange (#FF6600)
  - **Secondary:** Deep Black (#111111), Clean White (#FAFAFA)
  - **Accent:** Batik-inspired patterns and textures as design elements — warm golds, rich teals, earthy reds
  - **NOTE:** The vibe is energetic and eye-catching. Bold color blocks, high contrast. Think pop art meets batik — Western boldness with cultural texture.
- **Aesthetic:** "Bold, energetic, founder-friendly" — bright, high-contrast, modern. NOT corporate or sterile.
- **Photography Style:**
  - **Primary imagery:** Real photos of the founder working, laptop setups, behind-the-scenes of building. Authentic, not staged.
  - **Overlays:** Bold text overlays on images — key stats, punchy one-liners, before/after results
  - **People:** Founders at laptops, team working sessions, real humans (not stock). Diversity matters.
  - **Lighting:** Bright, clean, well-lit. Natural light or studio. High energy, not moody.
  - **Composition:** Clean with breathing room. Text-heavy overlays should be legible and punchy.
- **Design Elements:**
  - Pop art color blocks and borders
  - Batik-inspired decorative elements (buttons, dividers, background textures)
  - Bold sans-serif typography for headlines
  - Founder's face/personal brand as a trust signal
  - Data visualizations, funnel diagrams, before/after comparisons
- **Typography Feel:** Bold, geometric sans-serif for headlines. Clean and modern. Large text that demands attention.

## Content Pillars
1. **AI Automation Breakdowns** — "Here's exactly how we automated X for a SaaS client" (educational, tactical)
2. **Founder Marketing Tips** — Quick, actionable marketing advice for SaaS founders (value-first)
3. **Tool Reviews & Workflows** — Honest takes on AI tools, with real workflows (builds authority)
4. **Results & Case Studies** — Before/after, metrics, real outcomes (builds trust)
5. **Behind the Scenes** — Building in public, showing the process, YouTube content repurposed (builds connection)

## Caption Guidelines
- **Length:** 1-3 punchy sentences. Front-load the hook.
- **Structure:** Hook (pain point or bold claim) → Value (insight or solution) → CTA (what to do next)
- **Hashtags:** 3-5 max. Mix of: #SaaS #AIMarketing #ScaleBuds #FounderLife + 1 trending/relevant
- **CTA style:** "Link in bio", "DM me 'SCALE'", "Save this for later", "Tag a founder who needs this"
