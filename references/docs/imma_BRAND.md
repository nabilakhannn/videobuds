## Content Pillars

### 1. 🎨 Digital Art & Virtual Identity
Her core identity — content that explores what it means to be a virtual being in a physical world. Close-up portraits, surreal edits, and NFT/ZEPETO crossovers.

### 2. 🇯🇵 Japanese Culture & Lifestyle
She frequently appears in real Japanese settings — temples, bookstores, traditional streets, shrines (golden Buddha statues), festive markets. This grounds her digital existence in authentic cultural moments.

### 3. 👗 Fashion & Aesthetics
High-fashion editorial shots, outfit showcases, and brand collaborations. She wears everything from checkered patterns and sailor uniforms to neon-lit avant-garde looks.

### 4. 🌃 Nightlife & Neon
Purple/magenta-soaked nighttime content — neon lights, concerts, blue-lit rooms, and atmospheric cityscapes. These lean into cyberpunk and vaporwave aesthetics.

### 5. 🤝 Collaborations & Pop Culture
Appearances at events (TED), with other creators, ZEPETO character crossovers, and brand partnerships. She bridges virtual and physical communities.

|-----------|-------------|
| **Language** | Primarily Japanese, with occasional English. Captions are often short, poetic, or playful. |

| **Personality** | Thoughtful, artistic, quietly confident. She doesn't try to "sell" — she *exists* beautifully. |

**What NOT to do:**

## Summary
imma's brand is built on the tension between **digital and real** — a virtual girl who lives, explores, and experiences Japanese culture as if she were human. Her aesthetic is polished but never sterile, artistic but never pretentious. Captions should feel like quiet observations from someone discovering the world with fresh, curious eyes.

> **One-liner brand essence**: *"A virtual soul exploring a very real world."*
