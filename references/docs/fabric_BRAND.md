# Fabric of the Universe — Brand Voice & Style Guide

## Who We Are
- Techwear and cyberpunk-inspired streetwear brand building the wardrobe of the future
- Full product line: pullovers, bottoms, jackets, hats, and tactical accessories (100+ items)
- Established brand with a loyal following in the techwear/darkwear community

## Target Audience
- **The Person:** "Kai" — a 20-something creative who lives between anime culture, urban fashion, and tech. They're the one in the friend group whose outfit always gets photographed on the street.
- **Their Pain:** Mainstream fashion feels boring and cookie-cutter. They want to stand out but most "alternative" fashion is either costume-y or cheaply made.
- **Their Desire:** To wear clothes that feel like armor — functional, futuristic, and unmistakably different. Clothing that turns a sidewalk into a runway.
- **Where they hang out:** Instagram, TikTok, Reddit (r/techwearclothing, r/streetwear), Discord communities, anime conventions, K-pop/J-fashion spaces

## Tone & Voice
| Attribute    | Description |
|------------- |-------------|
| Formality    | Casual-cool. Like a brand that texts you, not emails you. Short, punchy, no corporate fluff. |
| Energy       | High-energy but controlled. Not screaming — more like a bass drop. Confident and magnetic. |
| Humor        | Dry wit, cultural references, meme-literate. Never corny, never try-hard. |
| Warmth       | Community-driven. The brand feels like a crew, not a corporation. "We" language, inclusive. |

### Signature Phrases
- "Built different." — product quality and design philosophy
- "The future wears black." — brand ethos
- "Street-ready. Future-proof." — tagline energy
- Short, punchy captions — let the visuals do the heavy lifting

### What We NEVER Do
- ❌ Generic "shop now!" sales language — we don't beg, we invite
- ❌ Bright, colorful, or "clean girl" aesthetics — we live in the shadows
- ❌ Neon cyberpunk lighting — our aesthetic is muted, industrial, not Blade Runner
- ❌ Long-winded product descriptions — we keep it tight
- ❌ Stock photography or basic flat-lays — every image is a mood
- ❌ Discount-heavy branding — we're not a clearance rack

## Visual Identity
- **Color Palette:**
  - **Primary:** Matte Black (#0A0A0A), White (#FFFFFF)
  - **Secondary:** Industrial Grey (#6B6B6B), Charcoal (#1C1C1E), Concrete Grey (#8C8C8C)
  - **Accent:** Blood Red (#CC0000) — subtle, on stitching and details only. Gold (#B8860B) — on chevron/military details
  - **NOTE:** The feed is overwhelmingly monochromatic. Black, white, and grey dominate 90%+ of all content. Color accents (red, gold) are rare and intentional.
- **Aesthetic:** "Dark, industrial, post-apocalyptic" — muted, desaturated, heavy shadows. NOT neon or bright.
- **Photography Style:**
  - **Backgrounds:** Grey concrete walls, industrial ruins, destroyed cityscapes, studio grey/dark backdrops, snow scenes (white contrast). Clean, muted, never busy or colorful.
  - **Model styling:** Face masks, balaclavas, tactical goggles, wide-brim hats — anonymity is a core visual theme. Models often have faces partially or fully obscured.
  - **Lighting:** Moody, desaturated, high-contrast. Heavy shadows. Cool-toned. No warm golden hour.
  - **Poses:** Power stances — wide legs, arms out, confrontational. Or quiet stillness with intensity.
- **CGI / Rendered Content:** The brand mixes real model photography with CGI/rendered characters — robot armies, armored figures, futuristic soldiers. This sci-fi world-building is a signature part of the feed aesthetic.
- **Typography Feel:** Geometric sans-serif. Clean, angular, utilitarian. The inverted triangle logo (▽) is the brand anchor and appears on nearly every piece.
- **Visual Elements:** Tactical straps, chest rigs, utility buckles, oversized silhouettes, layered outfits, high socks/boots, crossbody bags, face masks, military-inspired patches, chevron graphics

## Content Pillars
1. **Product Drops & Lookbooks** — Hero shots of new arrivals on grey/industrial backdrops, styled head-to-toe. The bread and butter.
2. **Street Style & Outfit Inspo** — Real people wearing the brand in moody, industrial environments. Masked models in urban ruins.
3. **Techwear Culture & World-Building** — CGI renders, futuristic soldiers, anime-inspired dark characters. Building a visual universe, not just selling clothes.
4. **Behind the Design** — Fabric choices, design details, the "why" behind tactical features. Educate without boring.
5. **Community Spotlight** — Reposting customer fits, featuring creators, building the crew.

## Platform Strategy
- **Primary:** Instagram — daily posts, mix of Reels (model movement in full fits), carousel lookbooks, single product hero shots on grey backdrops
- **Secondary:** TikTok — trend-jacking with techwear fits, outfit transitions, "get ready with me" in dark aesthetic
- **Tertiary:** YouTube — lookbook films, brand story mini-docs, seasonal collection drops

## Inspirations
- **ACRONYM** — the godfather of techwear. We take their obsession with function-meets-form.
- **HAMCUS** — post-apocalyptic aesthetics done right. We take their world-building approach to fashion.
- **Errolson Hugh** — his philosophy that clothing should be engineered, not just designed. We take his attention to material innovation.

## Caption Guidelines
Every social media caption MUST follow this structure:

1. **Short punchy text** — 1-2 sentences max, brand voice (casual-cool, confident, never salesy)
2. **At least one unique emoji** — pick cool/edgy emojis that match the brand (⚔️ 🖤 🔩 🌫️ 🕳️ 📦 🥷 💀 🛡️ ⛓️ 🗡️ 🔻 🏗️ ☁️), never basic (❤️ 😍 🔥 👏)
3. **Line break**
4. **CTA callout** — include the drop date and website. Vary the wording (e.g., "Reaper drops March 1st, 2026", "New drop landing March 1st", "Arriving March 1st, 2026"). Always end with `fabricoftheuniverse.com`
5. **Line break**
6. **2-3 hashtags** — rotate from: #techwear #darkwear #fabricoftheuniverse #fbrc #reaper #streetwear #techwearfit #techweardetails #newarrivals #futurewear
